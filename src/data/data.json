It’s also worth taking precautions when connecting to free Wi-Fi networks, such as in cafes or hotels. Spoof networks, given plausible-sounding names, are a threat, so it’s always worth checking the network’s name with staff.

Data should be disposed of correctly – with confidential documents shredded and hard drives securely wiped of any sensitive data before disposal.
